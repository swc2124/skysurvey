\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The top plot shows the cumulative area covered by all 100 targets each having a 200 Kpc box. The second plot is the individual are for each target. The last plot on bottom shows the hourly cost for the 200 Kpc box for each target. \relax }}{4}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2}{\ignorespaces Here we see the stars of all 11 halos projected and binned into a 100 x 100 grid. The grid covers a halo area of 600 x 600 Kpc. \relax }}{5}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3}{\ignorespaces Here we see each section of the 100 x 100 grid from the previous image. Here we have plotted the number of stars in each bin as a function of radius (Kpc). The three colors represent the number of stars per square degree with apparent magnitude less than that of the given limit. The horizontal lines represent the number of background galaxies per square degree corresponding to the apparent magnitude of the same color. \relax }}{6}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4}{\ignorespaces Here we see the same section of the 100 x 100 grid from the previous image but this time it is recalculated at 5 Mpc rather than 2 Mpc. \relax }}{7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {5}{\ignorespaces Once again we see the same plot but this time rendered at an estimated distance of 10 Mpc. \relax }}{8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces Here we see halo09, halo15 and halo20 displayed at $5\ Mpc$\ and viewed with WFIRST filter $h158$. The first three columns show a scatter plot with x-axis representing $0\ to\ 300\ Kpc$\ projected radius vs y-axis the log10 number of stars per square degree. The leftmost shows stars with an apparent magnitude of less than 26.7 in blue, the second column in red represents stars with app mag less than 23.5 and the last scatter column in black represents stars with app mag less than 22. The right column show the total number of stars per square degree out to a radius of +-180 Kpc. \relax }}{9}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {7}{\ignorespaces Again we see halo09, halo15 and halo20 but this time displayed at $8\ Mpc$. \relax }}{10}
